# Quotes (In suitecrm quote is more like the orders, but salesfoce create another module for it).

* Salesforce:
Quotes in Salesforce represent the proposed prices of your company’s products and services. You create a quote from an opportunity and its products. Each opportunity can have multiple associated quotes, and any one of them can be synced with the opportunity. When a quote and an opportunity are synced, any change to line items in the quote syncs with products on the opportunity, and vice versa. Get an overview of all your quotes on the Quotes tab. And if you’re using Lightning Experience, track sales activity in Path and stages in Kanban.
