# Salesforce
Track and manage your potential deals with Salesforce opportunities. Opportunities are deals in progress. Opportunity records track details about deals, including which accounts they’re for, who the players are, and the amount of potential sales. If your Salesforce admin has set up leads in your Salesforce org, an opportunity is created when a lead is converted. Opportunities can also be created directly for accounts you’re working.

Opportunity deal change highlights help sales teams prioritize their work by calling out recent changes in deal size and close date. For example, calling out recent changes to deals can help sales managers with their weekly coaching sessions. In the opportunities list view and Kanban view, text colors and arrows indicate changes in amounts and close dates over the last seven days. And users can hover over a highlighted opportunity to get more details about the changes.

As your deals progress toward the Proposal stage:

Add products and attach files, such as contracts or data sheets.
Log the calls you make.
Use Notes to jot down things during customer meetings.
Create tasks for key activities and calendar events for client meetings.
Send email to the opportunity contact or other key decision-makers.
During negotiation, share sales strategies with colleagues or to ask your manager for targeted guidance using Chatter. As you drive your deal from one stage to the next, update the opportunity record with the current stage. You’ll be closing deals in no time.

# SuiteCRM
An Opportunity is a qualified Sales prospect with a likely chance that they will be able to do business with your company. You have established that they have buying power and have entered into the buying cycle. This module allows you to track your Opportunities throughout the Sales Pipeline until the deal is 'Closed Lost or 'Closed Won'.
