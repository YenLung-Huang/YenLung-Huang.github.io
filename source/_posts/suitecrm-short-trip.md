## Setup SuiteCRM 7.11.18

For some reason, I started coding with SuiteCRM at least half of year.
Now, I will stop work with it because we lose our marketing team. No one will use it at all.
But I still want to write something for what I learn from it, and give this framework a thumb up.

## History

SuiteCRM is a fork from sugarcrm 6. What we uesd version is 7.11.18 community version.

Since it forked from sugarcrm 6. It had been change a lot. A new team give it a nice integration with third party.

## Features

* V8 Api
* Robo

I like the idea they did. Becasue we used ci/cd a lot. This give the application more flexible.

## Future

I had seen the team announce they will announce the SuiteCRM 8 at the end of 2020. But until I write this I still not see it.
