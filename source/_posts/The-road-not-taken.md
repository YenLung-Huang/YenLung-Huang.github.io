Today,I was think about how to be more productive.
And I just look around on the google and see how others programers did this.
After that I found this video from TED.

<div style="max-width:854px">
<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">
<iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/robert_frost_the_road_not_taken" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>
</div>

I will say that I really enjoy the senario with the poems. This really help me to be in that world.

> I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
